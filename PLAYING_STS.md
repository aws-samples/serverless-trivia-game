# Playing SimpleTriviaService (SimpleTriviaService)

Simple Trivia Service offers players the chance to create and play many different types of games. There are four types of games that players can play in Simple Trivia Service.

## Modes of Gameplay

There are four modes of gameplay in Simple Trivia Service. Single Player games are ones that players can play at any time after you run them and use an Amazon API Gateway HTTP endpoint.

Multiplayer - Casual and Multiplayer - Competitive games both use Amazon API Gateway WebSockets and requires a Host player to run the quiz, advancing answers and playing the role of an emcee. These modes allow all players to answer all questions and have one major difference which is the flow of the game. Multiplayer Casual games ask a question, show the answer, then show the scoreboard for each question. Multiplayer - Competitive games allow the Host to group questions together, much like you might find in a trivia contest in person. The Host will ask all the questions in a group, then show the answers for all questions in that group, and then the scoreboard after the group of questions is complete.

Multiplayer - Live Scoreboard mode uses AWS IoT and will only allow one player to win each question, much like a Jeopardy format.

## Types of Questions

There are two types of questions that can be asked, multiple choice and open answer. Multiple choice questions are ones in which you will provide between 2 and 4 answers to the player for them to choose from. You will identify which of the options is correct. Open Answer questions are ones in which the user must type the answer out. Open answer questions also have optional alternative answers, in which you can type a few answers that might be close enough to the correct answer to award points to a player.
